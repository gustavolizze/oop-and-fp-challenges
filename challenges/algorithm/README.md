## Challenge Algorithm

### Architecture

In this project, I proposed a more **functional approach**, using functional techniques and patterns.

- **Development folder**: `src`
- **Utils**: Contains shared utilities
- **Functions**: Modular structure where each folder contains the components of a function
- **Use-Cases**: Contains the use cases of the algorithm

### Commands

- `npm run build`: Build the TypeScript code  
- `npm start`: Run the algorithm (inputs are defined inside the `main.ts` file)  
- `npm run test`: Run unit tests

### Installation
